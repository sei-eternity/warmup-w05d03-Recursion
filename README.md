# Recursion Exercises

Work in groups to complete the functions written in the `recursion.js` file. 

You will have to add the necessary parameters to the functions.

You can test your progress by running `node recursion.js` inside the folder that contains the file, on your cli or the console, to see if your functions pass the test cases. 


> **Note**: The myGA lesson links out to a CodePen with a recursion exercise that's exactly the same as the one in the `recursion.js` file.
